There are many reasons for switching to jackson2 provider, see their release notes, and only reason we didn't use it 8.0 as well is that we forgot to switch it...
Both providers are bundled with AS since 7.1 times, we just changed what default was now.

see more about it at http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20 http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20Features

and http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonUpgradeFrom19To20 for migrating
